# Zack Adams

**Applied AI and Systems Engineer** • 📍 Baltimore, MD • 📫 imZackAdams@protonmail.com

## About Me

I build solution-oriented AI and data systems with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and real world usability.

My work sits at the intersection of applied machine learning, data pipelines, and lightweight infrastructure. I gravitate toward systems that are lean by default, easy to reason about, and cheap to operate often pushing logic to the edge or the browser when possible.

I care less about hype and more about whether a system:
- Ships cleanly
- Runs reliably  
- Solves an actual problem

## What I've Built

I've shipped and maintained:
- Edge hosted AI agents designed to run autonomously with minimal infrastructure
- Peer-to-peer systems that turn web browsers into distributed compute or communication networks
- Browser-native SDKs and payment flows requiring no backend services
- Python CLI tools published to PyPI for diagnosing real-world API and network issues
- Interpretable ML models used in complex, multi-factor decision environments

## Core Skills & Tooling

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL

**Machine Learning & Data:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib

**Systems & Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux, GitHub Actions, AWS/Azure APIs, data ingestion pipelines

**Web & Tooling:** Flask, REST APIs, CLI tooling, HTML/CSS

**Edge & Browser-Native:** WebRTC, WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebCrypto

## Selected Projects

- **NyxMesh** - Browser-native distributed compute in a single HTML file using WebRTC coordination
- **AIMless** - A 10KB p2p encrypted chat app in one HTML file with no server dependency
- **NyxPay** - Browser native payments toolkit with client-side wallet signing and static checkout flows
- **PingPoint** - Python CLI for diagnosing DNS, TLS, and HTTP issues (published on PyPI)
- **Nyx Bot Framework** - Edge hosted automation agent using multimodel inference (active rewrite)
- **Baltimore Law Bot** - NLP system transforming a 179-page housing law into structured, searchable answers
- **Data-Driven Baseball** - Machine learning system predicting MLB outcomes using historical pitcher-batter splits and lineup data (Flask deployment)

*More detail available in pinned repositories.*

## Current Focus

- Lightweight and modular AI/ML systems
- Browser native compute and peer-to-peer infrastructure
- Edge-deployed language models with memory
- Practical distributed and decentralized systems

## Get in Touch

Always open to interesting problems, collaborations, and side projects.
