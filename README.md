## 👋 About Me

I build solution minded systems and tools with a philosophy of simple, lean, efficient, and practical.

**Was once described as "an AI engineer who abuses index.html until it looks like infra."**

I have shipped:
* **Edge hosted LLM agents** that run cheaply and autonomously  
* **P2P meshes** that turn browsers into distributed compute grids  
* **Browser native SDKs and payment flows** with no backend required  
* **Diagnostic CLI tools** published to PyPI for debugging real world APIs  
* **Predictive ML models** for complex, multifactorial environments

## 🛠️ Core Skills and Tooling

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL  
**ML and AI**: PyTorch, Hugging Face, scikit learn, Keras, Transformers, RAG  
**Edge and Systems**: WebRTC, WebGPU, WebAssembly, WebCrypto  
**Infra and DevOps**: Docker, Linux, GitHub Actions, AWS, Azure  
**Backend and Web**: Flask, REST APIs, CLI tooling, HTML, CSS  
**Data and Visualization**: Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Featured Projects

* **NyxMesh**: P2P distributed compute in a single HTML file. Workers coordinate Mandelbrot, Monte Carlo pi, and other workloads using WebRTC. [Repo](https://github.com/ImZackAdams/nyx-mesh)  
* **AIMless**: A 10 KB single file chat app. Copy paste a blob, open an encrypted WebRTC channel, no server required. [Repo](https://github.com/ImZackAdams/AIMless)  
* **NyxPay**: Browser native payments toolkit. Client side wallet signing and static HTML checkout flows.  
* **PingPoint**: Python CLI that diagnoses DNS, TLS, and HTTP issues. Published on PyPI.  
* **Nyx Bot Framework (in rewrite)**: Edge hosted Twitter agent powered by multi model inference.  
* **Baltimore Law Bot**: NLP system parsing a 179 page housing law into structured, searchable answers.
* **Data Driven Baseball**: Machine learning system that predicts MLB outcomes using historical pitcher batter splits and lineup stats, deployed with Flask.

(More available in pinned repos or on request.)
