## 👋 About Me

I’m a systems focused engineer who builds **intelligent, modular, and production grade tools**. My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **backend engineering**, and **automation**—with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and real-world usability.

I’ve built and shipped:
- **LLM powered bots** running on edge hardware  
- **Developer facing SDKs** for decentralized payments  
- **CLI tools** deployed via PyPI to diagnose real world API failures
- **Predictive models** in highly variable, mutlifactorial environments.

I prioritize clean architecture, fast iteration, and solving problems that actually matter. Whether I’m designing for humans or machines, I build with intent and deploy with purpose.

## 🚫 Featured Work (Private / Selective Release)

Many of my projects are closed-source by design—focused on internal tooling, monetizable components, or ongoing systems. Highlights include:

- **Autonomous Agents**: LLM-driven bots with local inference, memory, and image generation  
- **Decentralized SDKs**: JavaScript tooling for secure token payments on Solana  
- **Diagnostic CLI Utilities**: Python packages for debugging real-world HTTP/DNS edge cases  
- **ML Applications**: Predictive pipelines for real-world outcomes (sports, legal, and behavioral domains)

Detailed descriptions available upon request.
