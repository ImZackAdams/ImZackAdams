## 👋 About Me

I am an engineer who builds **intelligent systems that run close to the user** at the edge, in the browser, and on device. My work blends **machine learning**, **distributed systems**, and **developer tools**, with a bias for clarity, efficiency, and real world impact.

I have shipped:
* **Edge hosted LLM agents** that run cheaply and autonomously  
* **Peer to peer meshes** that turn browsers into distributed compute grids  
* **Browser native SDKs and payment flows** with no backend required  
* **Diagnostic CLI tools** published to PyPI for debugging real world APIs  
* **Predictive ML models** for complex, multifactorial environments  

I design for resilience, speed, and usability, building tools that do more than just work, they last.
